With the barbell racked in front of the body on the anterior delts, the front squat emphasizes the quads and glutes, but also upper back and core strength to remain upright. Front squats can be trained as an alternative to back squats, as an accessory movement for either squats or deadlifts, or for strength and muscle on their own. Many lifters and athletes prefer them to back squats, although they can be uncomfortable and difficult to learn at first.\",\n          \"The kettlebell thruster is a popular kettlebell movement that combines a kettlebell front squat with a kettlebell press, while holding the bell in a goblet or bottoms-up grip. It is preceded by a clean at the start of each set, and you can perform a clean between each rep if you choose. It can be trained in traditional strength or muscle-building rep ranges, in circuit or fat-loss training, or as part of a larger kettlebell combination or complex.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Strength\",\n          \"Plyometrics\",\n          \"Strongman\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"BodyPart\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 17,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Abdominals\",\n          \"Adductors\",\n          \"Chest\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Equipment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Foam Roll\",\n          0,\n          \"Bands\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Level\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Intermediate\",\n          \"Beginner\",\n          \"Expert\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3.5421296443437438,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 9.6,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 72,\n        \"samples\": [\n          7.0,\n          3.1,\n          8.1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"RatingDesc\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Average\",\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}],"source":["dataset"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"metadata":{"id":"wUXsq27kDde0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1764483641135,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Nikhil Chaughule","userId":"03671436825058502843"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["dataset = dataset.apply(lambda x: x.str.strip() if x.dtype == \"object\" else x)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":9,"status":"ok","timestamp":1764483641143,"user":{"displayName":"Nikhil Chaughule","userId":"03671436825058502843"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"ffqbMAeVDvKH","outputId":"34b9aada-9f54-4328-e331-1e341476040e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","Data cleaning complete!
